The core directory for fabric8-maven-plugin regression tests

These tests are intended to test the overall integrity of fabric8-maven-
plugin in the fabric8 ecosystem. In case anything breaking in fabric8 
maven plugin, it would be a bit easier for the maintainers to find out
 what went wrong. So the basic flow of all these tests is following:

* Clone the sample project using fabric8 maven plugin
* Update it's pom version to latest SNAPSHOT version so that we test 
  local version of plugin
* Run a fabric8:deploy goal to deploy the application on top of 
  OpenShift cluster
* Query the application running inside the cluster, using REST call 
  or maybe by plain Kubernetes Client(asserting resources, labels etc)
* Redeploy the application and re-test; to check redeployment scenario.

== Travis CI Setup for regression-tests ==
These tests only run in a particular build profile( See rt/pom.xml).These
 are intended to run on each pull request. So we basically spin off a 
 live OpenShift cluster in order to test. See .travis.yml in project's 
root directory, for Travis setup which basically invokes a shell script 
(located in  ./rt/src/main/resources/scripts/prepare-test-environment.sh)
, to spin of various versions of OpenShift for tests.

== FUTURE WORK ==
* Add Support for OpenShift v3.7.0: Right now these tests seem to be failing on OpenShift v3.7.0, so it would be nice if the related build issues get fixed.
